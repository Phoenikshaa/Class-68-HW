Students participated in a ceremony where they took part in a “Buddy Bench pledge” that stated: “I promise to be kind to others. I promise to be understanding of people’s feelings. I will respect that everyone is different and an individual. I believe it is very important to be a good friend.” What a great way to kick off a Buddy Bench!</p>

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>
